# Supplementary Materials for diversity & team-performance meta-analysis

This meta-analysis was conducted as a registerered report, see [Stage 1 registration](https://osf.io/f5qdn/?view_only=73ccd1a3cb5d4ce29f9bef55caaae313): [update to unblinded link after review]

To be added after review: [Link to article]

# Overview

The supplementary materials are divided into two sections:

- `SM1`: Contains code and details on the search and screening process (not directly reproducible due to intervening manual steps)
- `SM2`: Contains code and results of the analysis (fully reproducible)

The materials are best accessible through the [webpage](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/diversity_meta/) that is build using the code in `create_sm` and saved in `docs`. The data can also be explored through an [interactive web application](https://2ly.link/1xekY).
